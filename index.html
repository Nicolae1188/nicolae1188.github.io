            <h3 id="1.1">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h3>
            <p>Technology has important effects on business and will keep growing in the future.
                        Technology will improve business’ communication by offering several ways of 
                        communicating such as email, instant messaging, video conferencing, business 
                        phones.It can increase the efficiency and the capacity of the business, saves 
                        time and money and it provides new innovations to protect the assets. Technology 
                        is essential to business success.Employees rely on it for day-to-day operations.
            </p>
            <h3 id="1.2">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects 
                successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What 
                skills?</h3>
            <p>In order to render a project successful,it must be planned using the kanban method and 
                tools like Trello to breakdown the project into visual tasks and Slack to ensure communication between members of the team.One of the essential skills for project management is the ability to communicate well-understanding and being understood.
                    Effective communication is important in relation to project team dynamics.</p> 
            <h3 id="1.3">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? 
                Include a link to your trello board.</h3>
            <p>As part of the plan , I have identified the components required to build the website.
                    I’ve created 5 lists in the <a href="https://trello.com/b/7rNfzP63">board</a> (Trello), Assessment 1,Assessment 2, To Do List , Doing and Done.
                    In the Assessment 1 and 2 I’ve added the Assessment requirements.I wanted a name and a good design for my website which I placed as tasks in the To Do List.
                      </p>  
            <h3 id="1.4">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h3>
            <p>Not having a clear picture of what it needs to be done in advance.A leader not providing support or lack of experience.
                    <br>Schedule risk, the risk that activities will take longer than expected. Slippages in schedule typically increase costs and, also, delay the receipt of project benefits, with a possible loss of competitive advantage.Performance risk, the risk that the project will fail to produce results consistent with project specifications.
                    </p>        
            <h3 id="1.5">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
            <p>Choosing up-to-date hardware with enough resources to carry out the tasks and compatible software with the right features for the job is a big deal.
                    In general people are choosing whatever suits them.For example,a user-friendly or customizable interface helps me setup my work environment based on my preferences and keep things lighter.
                    </p>  
            <h3 id="1.6">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h3>
            <p>Trello is a task management app that gives you a visual overview of what is being worked on and who is working on it. It used the Kanban system, which was developed as a system to keep production levels high and maintain flexibility.Trello is a system of boards, lists and cards which helped me to get from nothing to something.<br>

                <br>The feature GitHub Pages on GitHub website is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.
                I’ve used GitHub Pages as host to make my website live.
                </p>  
            <h3 id="1.7">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h3>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area.
                <br>
                    <br>The regulation has a number of aims all designed to increase and standardise the protection of individuals including:
                <ul>
                        <li>data portability</li>
                        <li>the right to be forgotten</li>
                        <li>the right to prevent profiling</li>
                        <li>the right to object to processing</li>
                        <li>the right to rectification and erasure</li>
                        <li>subject access requests</li>

                        
               </ul><p>GDPR will have a huge impact on website design, which will have a ripple effect on how your website integrates with your other digital activity like email marketing, social media, and e-commerce activities.<br>The thread that ties together all of these recommendations is that under the GDPR, the concept of consent being given freely, specific and informed is being strengthened, with new rules.</p>

                    </p> 
                    <h3 id="2.2">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello.</h3>
                    <p>The tools were appropriate for the job, Trello helped me have a visual of my ideas for the project and keep them organized through a system of boards , lists and cards.
                            <br>Visual Studio Code is a very simple IDE with  great power under the hood and very friendly interface.
                            </p>  
            <h3 id="3.2">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency. </h3>
            <p>Distractions include the phone, email notifications and having multiple web browsers open on the desktop.
                    <br>Estimate the time you need to tackle different tasks and set a timer for each of your tasks. When it comes to the time limit, move on to another task first.
                    <br>You can’t always be working at optimum productivity. Instead, you should shoot for working in short bursts at your most productive times.
                    <br><a href="https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/15-ways-to-increase-productivity-at-work.html">[2]</a></p>
            <h3 id="3.3">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
            <p>Considering the magnitude of the project I would definitely assemble a team and assign members to specific tasks.Also configure a channel in Slack for the team to be able to collaborate,communicate,etc.
                    <br>Setting a deadline will force me to find the best and fastest way to complete the tasks.
                    </p>
            <h3 id="3.4">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h3>
            <p>All the function within a website must be tested to ensure that there are no technical issues and everything works smoothly.
                <br> Having a compatibility test is essential as it will check the website for browser compatibility or operating system compatibility.
                <br>Testing the performance of the website usually shows the behaviour under different operations.
                <br> Testing the security is very important for the web applications relating data protections.There are several things that can be tested like CAPTCHA , SSL ,etc.

            <h2 id="h0">Review</h2>
            <p>The lack of experience using the tools had a big impact on the project as I couldn’t accomplish the exact vision of the website. Despite everything I was able to build the website carrying out a large amount of tasks in a very little time as the tools allowed me to be productive and effective. <br>The project grew bigger and bigger and I had to keep it simple giving up on some ideas. Thus ,having a team is essential for the project. 
                Overall the tools are powerful , user-friendly ,free to use and customizable to provide best experience. If I would have had a team for the project it would have been delivered according to the initial vision.<br>
                The website’s content should be divided on multiple pages instead of having a long long scroll down, so for this matter <br>a drop-down menu at the top and back to top button at the bottom was introduced to ease the navigation through the content.
